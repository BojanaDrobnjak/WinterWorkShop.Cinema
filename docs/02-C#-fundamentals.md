#Introduction

C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java.
Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in C# within a very short time. 
C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, 
lambda expressions and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance,
and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code. 

As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, 
the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. 
Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. 

## OOP

### OOP represent

*   Abstraction – Refers to the process of exposing only the relevant and essential data to the user without showing unnecessary information.
*   Polymorphism – Allows you to use an entity in multiple forms.
*   Encapsulation – Prevents the data from unwanted access by binding of code and data in a single unit called object.
*   Inheritance – Promotes the reusability of code and eliminate the use of redundant code. 
    It is the property through which a child class obtains all the features defined in its parent class. 

## SOLID

### SOLID represent

*   S – Single-responsibility principle – A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
*   O – Open-closed principle – Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
*   L – Liskov substitution principle – Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. 
    Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
*   I – Interface segregation principle – A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use 
    or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
*   D – Dependency Inversion Principle – Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. 
    It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

## Class and Object

### What is class?

A class describes all the attributes of object, as well as the methods that implement the behavior of member objects. 
It is a comprehensive data type, which represent a blue print of objects. It is a template of object. 

### What is object?

Objects are instances of classes. An object is an entity that has attributes, behavior and identity. 
Attributes and behavior of an object are defined by the class definition. 

### Relationship between class and an object?

A class acts as a blue-print that defines properties, states and behaviors that are common to a number of objects.
An object is an instance of the class.
